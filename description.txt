Description

Objective: HQ Platform team have suggested not to use custom RBAC role - RBAC_SCOP_PRD_DEVELOPER and use only RBAC_SCOP_MEMBER/RBAC_SCOP_PL role. However, there are privilege permission which are mapped to RBAC_SCOP_PRD_DEVELOPER, will need to make sure same permissions are mapped with RBAC_SCOP_MEMBER which will be used going forward. Some of these permissions are - port forwarding, perform exec into the pods.

Context: Will remove any dependency on the custom roles - RBAC_SCOP_PRD_DEVELOPER.

Scope: Grant same set of permission to RBAC_SCOP_MEMBER which RBAC_SCOP_PRD_DEVELOPER have.

Approach:

Reachout the engineering team for all the permissions required on the RBAC_SCOP_MEMBER role. Including - port forwarding and performing exec

Modify the policies on the EKS cluster to grant these permissions to the respective roles.

Validate the changes and also let engineering team to validate.

Acceptance criteria/DOD:

RBAC_SCOP_MEMBER perform all the operations which are possible with the RBAC_SCOP_PRD_DEVELOPER on the cluster.

Changes are validated by the engineering team.


Dependencies\Blockers: Engineering team to provide the permission which are required. Need to determine if the permission changes need to be done at cluster level or AWS level.
Risks & Mitigation: N/A
